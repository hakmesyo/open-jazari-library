/**
 * 
 * Java Implementation of the Hough Transform.
 * Used for finding straight lines in an image.
 * by Olly Oechsle
 * 
 * 
 * Note: This class is based on original code from:
 * <a
 * href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/hough.htm">http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/hough.htm</a>
 * If you represent a line as:
 * x cos(theta) + y sin (theta) = r
 * ... and you know values of x and y, you can calculate all the values of r by
 * going through all the possible values of theta. If you plot the values of r
 * on a graph for every value of theta you get a sinusoidal curve. This is the
 * Hough transformation.
  * The hough tranform works by looking at a number of such x,y coordinates,
 * which are usually found by some kind of edge detection. Each of these
 * coordinates is transformed into an r, theta curve. This curve is discretised
 * so we actually only look at a certain discrete number of theta values.
 * "Accumulator" cells in a hough array along this curve are incremented for X
 * and Y coordinate.
 * The accumulator space is plotted rectangularly with theta on one axis and r
 * on the other. Each point in the array represents an (r, theta) value which
 * can be used to represent a line using the formula above.
  * Once all the points have been added should be full of curves. The algorithm
 * then searches for local peaks in the array. The higher the peak the more
 * values of x and y crossed along that curve, so high peaks give good
 * indications of a line.
