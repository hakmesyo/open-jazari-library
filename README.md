# OJL
 Open Jazari Library
 
 OJL is a Java based low-code/no-code machine-learning, deep-learning, image processing, data visualization and matrix library developed as method chaining fashion. It is sufficient for the user to generate an object from the CMatrix class with the help of the getInstance() method. A few examples of using the OJL will be listed below.
 
Example 1: A program that generates a vector of consecutive integers from 0 to 10 and writes their values to the screen
